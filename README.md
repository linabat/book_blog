Hey there! So glad you found my page! I love reading and tracking all the books I've read! I am currently working creating a personal bookblog page for all the books I've read called "Thought Dump". I am currently on deploying this webpage so that it can easily be accessible, but for now, enjoy this clip of a preview of I've built!
