              The goal of this website is to share my book updates with you all. I've been wanting to creating this page for 
              quite sometime at this point and have finally done it! üéâ As an avid reader, I've read so many books at this point.
              I will share my raw thoughts, opinions, and ratings of the books I've read. Unfortunatley, this list right now is cut 
              short because I only started reviewing book at the end of 2022 -- but do not fear, I will keep you constantly in the loop 
              with my latest reads!
